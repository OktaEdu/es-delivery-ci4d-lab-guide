üéØ **Objective**: Sign in to your virtual machine and authenticate to your Okta organization.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 15 minutes

### Access Your Credentials

In your VM, click on the arrow to the right of the Desktop to expand the **Credentials** panel that will reveal your Okta org credentials.

![Expand the Credentials Panel](./.tour-resources/1-1_expand_sidebar.gif)

Keep this panel open for the following step.

### Access Your Okta Admin Dashboard

1. Launch the Chrome browser.

2. In your VM's **Credentials** panel, click the ![copy](./.tour-resources/copy.png) icon in the `Link` section. This will automatically paste your Okta org URL into the Chrome browser.

3. Click into the URL address bar in the Chrome browser and hit `Enter` to navigate to your Okta org.

4. Once the Okta Sign-In page loads, click into the `Username` field.

5. In your VM's **Credentials** panel, click the ![copy](./.tour-resources/copy.png) icon in the `Login` section. This will automatically paste your admin account's username into the **Username** field.

6. In the Okta interface, click `Next`

7. In your VM's **Credentials** panel, click the ![copy](./.tour-resources/copy.png) icon in the `Password` section. This will automatically paste your admin account's password into the **Password** field.

8. In the Okta interface, click `Verify`
9. Once logged in to Okta, click the `Admin` button to enter the Admin Dashboard.

You may now collapse the Credentials side panel in your VM.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have access to your lab environment to complete the rest of the labs.

### Lab 1.2: Create Okta Groups

üéØ **Objective** Create Okta Groups -- one for Okta Ice Franchisees and one for Okta Ice customers. Create a Group rule for automatically adding certain users to the Customers group.

üé¨ **Scenario** Franchisees and customers require distinct groups for application access and access policies.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 10 minutes

### Create a Franchisee Group

1.  Ensure you are logged in as your Okta Super Admin account `oktatraining` and that you are on the `Admin` dashboard.

2.  Navigate to `Directory > Groups`

3.  Click `Add Group`

4.  In the `Name` field, enter `Franchisees`

5.  In the `Description` field, enter `All Franchisees`

6.  Click `Save`

### Create a Customer Group

1.  Click `Add Group` again.

2.  This time, enter `Customers` in the `Name` field and `All Customers` in the `Description` field.

3.  Click `Save`

### Create a Group Rule for the Customer Group

Now we will create a rule so that any user created that has the `userType` `customer` will automatically be added to the Customer group. This will be helpful when we import existing users with the Users API in Module 6.

1. On the top of the **Groups** page, click the `Rules` tab.
2. Click **Add Rule**
3. Name the rule `Add customer userType to Customers Group`
4. Set the **IF** section to read: IF `User attribute` `userType` `Equals` `customer`
5. In the **THEN Assign to** section, type and select the `Customers` group.

6. Click `Save`

### Activate the Group Rule

You should now see the `Add customer userType to Customers Group` rule listed on the **Group Rules** page.

Notice, however, that the `Status` is `Inactive`, so we'll need to activate it:

1. Click the drop down next to `Inactive`

2. Select `Activate`

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

You now have two Okta Groups that you will use to manage access to applications.

### Lab 1.3 Create Okta Users

üéØ **Objective**: Create some End User accounts and assign them to Okta Groups for testing configurations.

üé¨ **Scenario**: We'll need some End Users to test out the Franchisee and Customer experience.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 15 minutes

### Navigate to the People Directory

1. Ensure you are signed in as your Super Admin account, `oktatraining`.

Last, click the `Save` button.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

You now have a test user in the Franchisee group and a test user in the Customer group.

### Lab 1.4: Create Okta Application Integrations

üéØ **Objective** Create Okta application integrations for two existing applications. Assign one application to the Customers group and assign one application to the Franchisee group.

üé¨ **Scenario** Customers and Franchisees require access to a different set of applications.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 15 minutes

### Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

In Okta, **CORS** allows JavaScript hosted on your website to make a request using an
`XMLHttpRequest` to the Okta API. While we aren't hosting the Okta Sign-In Widget when we use the Redirect Model, our sample applications **_do_** call out to Okta's API to close an Okta session and log a user out. Every website origin must be explicitly permitted as a **Trusted Origin** in your Okta org.

1. Ensure you are logged in to the Admin Dashboard as `oktatraining`

2. In the Admin menu, navigate to `Security` > `API`

3. Click on the `Trusted Origins` tab.

4. Click the `Add Origin` button

5. Enter `Okta Ice Portal` into the **Origin name** field.

6. Enter `http://localhost:8080` into the **Origin URL** field.

7. Under **Choose Type**, select `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)`
8. Click `Save`

### Navigate to Applications

In the Admin menu, navigate to `Applications` > `Applications`

### Create an Application Integration for the Rewards App

The Rewards app is an existing application in this project. We're going to set up an integration in Okta so our customers can access this application. We'll talk about the code implementation in subsequent modules.

1. Click `Create App Integration`

2. Select the `OIDC - OpenID Connect` radio button.

3. Select the `Single-Page Application` radio button.

4. Click `Next`

5. Name this application `Customer Rewards`

6. In the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field, enter `http://localhost:8080/redirect/rewards.html`

7. Under **Assignments** click the radio button option for `Limit access to select groups`

8. Type in and select `Customers`

9. Click `Save`

### Configure the Rewards Application `appClientId`

The Rewards application makes use of Okta's AuthJS SDK, which we will learn about more in the next module. For now, you'll simply need to configure the ClientID and Okta Org URL to make this integration work.

1. Copy the `Client ID` that was displayed after you saved your integration.

2. Here in VSCode, notice that `rewards.html` has opened for you automatically and the line containing the `appClientID` variable is highlighted. Currently there is a placeholder value of `"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`

3. Double click the placeholder value to highlight its contents and press `CTRL`+`V` to paste your `Client ID` value so that it is enclosed in the double quotes.

### Configure the Rewards Application `baseOktaURL`

1. Notice that `rewards.html` is still open, but now the line containg the the `baseOktaURL` variable is highlighted. It contains the placeholder value `https://oktaice######.oktapreview.com`

2. Highlight the placeholder value **excluding** the quotation marks. Ensure your cursor is now between the quotation marks.

3. Open your VM's **Credentials** panel by clicking on the arrow to the right hand side of the VM screen.

4. In your VM's **Credentials** panel, click the ![copy](./.tour-resources/copy.png) icon in the `Link` section. This will automatically paste your Okta org URL into `rewards.html` where your cursor was placed. Ensure it was pasted in the correct location and that the URL is enclosed in double quotes.

5. Save your `rewards.html` file.

### Create an Application Integration for the CRM App

We will complete the same steps for the Franchisee app. The one difference is we will assign this app to the Franchisee group. See how many steps you can complete without referring to the instructions!

1. Back in Okta, click `‚Üê Back to Applications`

2. Click `Create App Integration`

3. Select the `OIDC - OpenID Connect` radio button.

4. Select the `Single-Page Application` radio button.

5. Click `Next`

6. Name this application `Franchisee CRM`

7. In the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field, enter `http://localhost:8080/redirect/crm.html`

8. Under **Assignments** click the radio button option for `Limit access to select groups`

9. Type in and select `Franchisees`

10. Click `Save`

### Configure the CRM Application `appClientId`

1. Copy the `Client ID` that was displayed after you saved your integration.

2. Here in VSCode, notice that `crm.html` has opened for you automatically and the line containing the `appClientID` variable is highlighted. Currently there is a placeholder value of `"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`

3. Double click the placeholder value to highlight its contents and press `CTRL`+`V` to paste your `Client ID` value so that it is enclosed in the double quotes.

### Configure the CRM Application `baseOktaURL`

1. Notice that `crm.html` is still open, but now the line containg the the `baseOktaURL` variable is highlighted. It contains the placeholder value `https://oktaice######.oktapreview.com`

2. Highlight the placeholder value **excluding** the quotation marks. Ensure your cursor is now between the quotation marks.

3. Open your VM's **Credentials** panel by clicking on the arrow to the right hand side of the VM screen.

4. In your VM's **Credentials** panel, click the ![copy](./.tour-resources/copy.png) icon in the `Link` section. This will automatically paste your Okta org URL into `crm.html` where your cursor was placed. Ensure it was pasted in the correct location and that the URL is enclosed in double quotes.

5. Save your `crm.html` file.

6. **Log out** of your Okta org since you will be logging in as a different user in the subsequent steps.

### Start the Web Server

1. Open a new terminal in VSCode

2. Notice that the terminal automatically opens to the project directory.

3. Issue the command `python -m http.server 8080`

### Test out the Rewards App

Before following the directions below, that ensure you are **logged out** of any Okta sessions. **DO NOT use an Incognito browser window** for the steps that follow.

1. In Chrome, visit http://localhost:8080

2. Click the `Rewards App (Redirect)` link. You should be redirected to Okta to sign in.

3. Log in as `soraya.esfeh@oktaice.com`/`Tra!nme4321`

You should be redirected back to the Rewards app and you should see some information printed to the page that we will discuss later. For now you can see Soraya's email address at the top as well as your app's Client ID at the bottom.

### Try to Access the CRM App

1. Still logged in as Soraya, click `Return to Portal`

2. Click on `CRM App (Redirect)`

3. The CRM application does not load because Soraya is not authorized to access this application. The CRM app is only assigned to users in the `Franchisees` group and she is not a member of that group.

4. Click the `Close Okta Session` button.

5. Click `Return to Portal`

### Log in as a Franchisee Partner

Now we're going to log in as Kay West, who is a member of the Franchisees group.

1. Click on `Rewards App (Redirect)`

2. Enter `kay.west@oktaice.com` as the login and click `Next`

3. Notice that this user did not have an existing session with Okta before trying to access an application that is not assigned to them. In this case, we are not even prompted for a password to authenticate and we are told that the application is not assigned to the user. The user still does not have a session.

4. Click `Return to Portal`

5. Click on `CRM App (Redirect)`

6. Log in as `kay.west@oktaice.com`/`Tra!nme4321`

You should be redirected back to the CRM app and you should see see Kay's email address at the top as well as your app's Client ID at the bottom.

### End Your Okta Session and Shut Down the Web Server

1. Click the `Close Okta Session` button.

2. In the terminal window in VSCode where you launched the web server, press `CTRL`+`C` to stop the web server.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

You now know how to set up an application integration in Okta.

### üéâ End of Module 1 Labs

**You may close this workspace project, ensuring all changes were saved.**

## Module 2: Customizing the Okta-Hosted Sign In Widget

### Lab 2.1 Configure a Custom Domain

üéØ **Objective:** Configure a custom domain in Okta and configure your DNS to support the custom URL.

üé¨ **Scenario** Continuing with the white label experience, Okta Ice wants to change the Okta URL to its own domain. In this lab, you will configure Okta and your DNS to change the Okta URL end-users will use.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration:** 20 minutes

### Configure a Subdomain

1. Log in to your Okta org as `oktatraining` and click the `Admin` button to enter the Admin Dashboard.
2. Click `Customizations` > `Domain`
3. In the **Redirect URL** section, click `Edit` and then click the `Get started` button.
4. To prepare for the next step, expand the **Credentials** panel in your VM.

![Start Code Tour](./.tour-resources/1-1_expand_sidebar.gif)

### Fill Out Your Fully-Qualified Domain

The fully-qualified domain you will use for this step consists of a **subdomain** and a **domain** in the format `oktaice########.coffee-ice.com`

1. In the **Add domain** form on Okta, click into the `Domain` field.

2. In the **Credentials** panel in your VM, click the ![paste from VM](./.tour-resources/copy.png) icon next to `Subdomain` to paste your subdomain into this field.

3. Click back into the `Domain` field in the **Add domain** form.

4. Append `.coffee-ice.com` after your subdomain. It should now look something like `oktaice########.coffee-ice.com`

5. Under **Certificate management**, ensure `Okta-managed` is selected.

6. Click `Next`.

Okta will now provide you with a `TXT` value and a `CNAME` value, which we will use in the next step to verify that we own this domain.
![Getting values from Okta to set up the custom domain](./.tour-resources/custom-domain.gif)

### Log In to the DNS Configuration Tool

In a new tab, navigate to our DNS configuration tool at [https://oktaice.store/dns/](https://oktaice.store/dns/) and log in with the following information (replacing ######## with your assigned subdomain number from the **Credentials** panel in your VM)

| Field Name |             Value |
| ---------- | ----------------: |
| Subdomain  | `oktaice########` |
| Domain     |  `coffee-ice.com` |
| Username   |    `oktatraining` |
| Password   |     `Tra!nme4321` |

When you log in, verify that you have logged in to modify the DNS entries for the correct subdomain and domain.

There should not be any entries. If there are, delete them.

![Logging in to the DNS tool](./.tour-resources/dns-tool.gif)

### Add the TXT Entry

1.  Click `Add Entry`

2.  In the `Type` section, choose `TXT`

3.  Switch back to your Okta tab

4.  Copy the **Host** entry next to in the **TXT** row (e.g.,`_acme-challenge.oktaice########.coffee-ice.com`)

5.  Switch back to the DNS configuration tool

6.  Paste this text into the `Host` field

7.  Switch back to your Okta tab

8.  Copy the **Value** entry in the **TXT** row (a unique value generated by Okta)

9.  Switch back to the DNS configuration tool

10. Paste this text into the `Value` field

11. Click `Add`

![Adding the TXT contents](./.tour-resources/add-txt.gif)

### Add the CNAME Entry

1.  In the `Type` section, choose `CNAME`
2.  Switch back to your Okta tab
3.  Copy the **Host** entry in the **CNAME** row (e.g., `oktaice########.coffee-ice.com`)
4.  Switch back to the DNS configuration tool
5.  Paste this text into the `Host` field
6.  Switch back to your Okta tab
7.  Copy the **Value** entry in the **CNAME** row (Your Okta org URL)
8.  Switch back to the DNS configuration tool
9.  Paste this text into the `Value` field
10. Click `Add`
11. Click `Cancel`
12. You should now see the two entries you added
13. You can now log out of the DNS configuration tool and close the tab

![Adding the NAME contents](./.tour-resources/add-name.gif)

### Issue an Okta-Managed Certificate

Navigate back to the Okta tab and click `Next`. Okta will take a moment to verify the DNS 01 challenge:

- If verification fails, go back and check that you entered both the TXT and CNAME records correctly

- If verification is successful, Okta will issue a TLS certificate for your custom domain. Click `Finish`.

You will see a status of **Pending** for your custom domain as it can take several minutes to half an hour for the domain to become ready.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have configured a custom domain for your Okta org. Setting up a custom domain also allows you to customize the Okta-hosted SIW.

### Lab 2.2: Customize the Okta Sign-In Page With the Branding UI

üéØ **Objective:** Customize the Okta Sign-In Page with Okta Ice branding.

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice needs a branded Sign-In Page for a complete white label experience.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration:** 20 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisite:** Lab 2-1

### Access the Sign-in Page Code Editor

1.  If you aren't already, sign in to your Okta org as your Super Admin acount `oktatraining`

2.  From the Admin dashboard, click `Customizations` > `Branding`

3.  Under the **Pages** section, find the `Sign-in page` and click `Edit`

4.  Click the `Code editor` toggle button

### The Default Sign-in Page Code

The code from the default Okta-hosted sign-in Page has been copied here so we can explore it more in depth. You can customize the Okta-hosted sign-in page, not only by modifying the code in the Sign-in Page Code Editor, but by configuring settings in Okta's Branding UI. Your Okta org must have Branding enabled to use Okta's Branding UI.

      oktaSignIn.renderEl(
        { el: "#okta-login-container" },
        OktaUtil.completeLogin,
        function (error) {
          // Logs errors that occur when configuring the widget.
          // Remove or replace this with your own custom error handler.
          console.log(error.message, error);
        }
      );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Examine the Sign-in Page Mustache Variables

Throughout the default Sign-in Page code, you will see variables surrounded by curly braces `{{}}` such as the one highlighted here. This is because the Okta Sign In Page template uses the Mustache templating language in its HTML. These variables reference relevant values for the Sign In Page to load such as the favicon URL.

### Sign-in Page Variable: `themedStylesUrl`

The variable `{{themedStylesUrl}}` generates a CSS file that defines the primary and secondary colors for this page.

### Sign-in Page Variable: `faviconUrl`

The `{{faviconUrl}}` variable inserts the URL for the favicon. The favicon can be changed in the Okta Branding UI.

### Sign-in Page Variable: `pageTitle`

The `{{pageTitle}}` variable inserts the page title set in the Okta Branding UI.

### Sign-in Page Variable: `SignInWidgetResource`

The `SignInWidgetResource` variable loads the JavaScript and CSS files required to use the Okta Sign-In Widget.

### Sign-in Page Variable: `bgImageUrl`

The `{{bgImageUrl}}` variable inserts the URL to the background image configured in your Okta organization. You can upload and set this background image in the Okta Branding UI.

### Sign-in Page Variable: `OktaUtil`

Defines a global `OktaUtil` JavaScript object that contains methods used to complete the Okta sign-in flow. When an application uses the Okta-hosted sign-in page to sign a user in, information (called request context) is available about the target application and the request.

### Sign-In Widget JavaScript

Next we'll walk through this bit of JavaScript that is responsible for rendering the Okta Sign-In Widget (SIW) on the sign in page. The SIW itself is a JavaScript library.

### SIW JavaScript: `config` Variable

The `config` variable gets the configuration of the Sign-In Widget, This configuration, at minimum, defines the `issuer`, `clientId`, and `redirectUri`

### SIW JavaScript: Creating an `OktaSignIn` Object

This line instantiates a new `OktaSignIn` object with the configurations we have stored in `config`. This will be used to render the SIW in the following lines.

### SIW JavaScript: Rendering the Okta SIW

The `OktaSignIn` object is then used to call the `renderEl()` method to render the SIW. Let's take a look at the method signature to break down what's being passed to this method:

```
 renderEl(renderOptions: RenderOptions, successFn?: RenderSuccessCallback, errorFn?: RenderErrorCallback): Promise<RenderResult>
```

#### Render Options

This parameter takes render options for the SIW in the form of JSON data. It must include the `el` or `$el` property.
In this case, we're passing a CSS class `#okta-login-container`, which will render the SIW in a `div` of this class.

#### Success Callback

This parameter expects a function, which gets called upon successfully configuring and rendering the widget.

#### Error Callback

This paramater expects a function, which gets called if there is an error when configuring and rendering the widget. Currently, we are simply logging the error to console.

### Access the Okta Branding UI

Before we make any changes to the default Sign-in Page code, let's see what we can customize the SIW without touching any code at all. We'll do this with Okta's Branding UI.

Navigate to `Customize` > `Branding`

Under the `Theme` section, you can define:

- Primary and Secondary colors
- Logo
- Favicon
- Background

### Customize the Primary and Secondary Colors

In the default Sign-in Page code, the primary color is applied to the `Sign In` button and the secondary color is applied to the background color of the Sign-in page.

Change the Primary color to `#2d75bb`

Change the Secondary color to `#c7e5f5`

### Customize the Logo

Next, we're going to upload a custom logo to be displayed at the top of the SIW.

1. Click the pencil icon next to the `Logo` item
2. Select `Upload new image`
3. Open `C:\ClassFiles\02-customizing-okta-hosted-siw\img\ice-logo.png`

![Our Custom Logo](./img/ice-logo.png)

### Customize the Favicon

Next, we're going to upload a custom favicon.

1. Click the pencil icon next to the `Favicon` item
2. Select `Upload new image`
3. Open `C:\ClassFiles\02-customizing-okta-hosted-siw\img\favicon.png`

![Our Custom Logo](./img/favicon.png)

### Customize the Background Image

Next, we're going to upload a custom background image.

1. Click the pencil icon next to the `Background` item
2. Select `Upload new image`
3. Open `C:\ClassFiles\02-customizing-okta-hosted-siw\img\ice-cream-bg.png` and, finally, click `Save Changes`

![Our Custom Logo](./img/ice-cream-bg.png)

Click `Save Changes`

### Apply the Theme to the Sign-in Page

Now that we have customized our theme, we need to apply it to our Sign-in page.

1. In the section labeled `Pages`, click `Edit` on the item labelled `Okta-hosted Sign-In Page`
2. Click the style labeled `Solid background` and observe the change in the preview panel. This style uses our custom logo, applies the primary color to the `Sign In` button, and uses the secondary color as the solid background for the page.
3. Click the style labelled `Image background` and observe the change in the preview panel. This style is the same as the above, but it applies our image background to the page.
4. Click `Save and Publish`

### Preview the Sign-In Page

Notice that you can see a preview of the Sign-In Page to the right.

To see a live version of this page, click the `Visit page` link near the top of the page.

**Keep your Sign-In Page open for the next lab**

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

We have seen how we could customize the SIW without touching the Sign-in Page code through Okta's Branding UI. For some use cases, this level of customization is enough! For other use cases, we might want to customize the Sign-in Page beyond what Okta's Branding UI can offer. In the next lab, we use the integrated Sign-in Page code editor to achieve this.

### Lab 2.3: Customize the Okta Sign-In Page Using the Sign-In Page Code Editor

üéØ **Objective:** Further customize the Sign-In Page with the Sign-In Page Code Editor.

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice wants to further customize the Sign-In Page beyond what is offered by the Okta Branding UI.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration:** 30 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisite:** Lab 2-1 and 2-2

### Note about this lab:

In this lab, you will be adding code to the default Okta Sign-In Page html. For the best learning experience, you are highly encouraged to type the code in manually.

To provide a differentiated experience for learners of all types, we've included an `Insert Code` link after each coding segment. This inserts the code to the correct line(s) automatically. After you insert the code, you will still have to click `Next` to advance to the next lab step.

### Inspect the Sign-In Page Elements

You should still have the Sign-In Page preview open from the last lab. If you do not have this page open, ensure you are signed in as your `oktatraining` and:

1. Navigate to `Customizations` > `Branding`
2. In the **Pages** section, find `Sign-in page` and click the `Edit` button.
3. Click `Visit page`

On the preview of your Sign-In Page, right click on the page and select `Inspect` and ensure that you are viewing the `Elements` tab and the `Styles` sub-tab.
![Inspect Elements](./.tour-resources/inspect-element.gif)

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `SHIFT` + `CONTROL` + `C`

### Inspect the Form Label Element

One of the elements we may want to customize, is the font color of the text in the SIW. Let's inspect the `Username` form label in the SIW by right-clicking on the element and selecting `Inspect`

Notice that this updates what we see in `Elements` and `Style` and we can see that the CSS selector that defines the text color for this element is `#okta-sign-in *`

![Inspect Elements](./.tour-resources/inspect-label.gif)

### Update the Font Color of General Text in the SIW

We now know that the text color of the general text elements in the SIW is defined by the `#okta-sign-in *` selector so now we can add some embedded CSS to the Sign-In Page code. We'll make changes here first before checking the changes in the embedded Sign-In Page Code Editor.

Notice that this lab step automatically points to a particular line in the HTML code. This is where you will be adding some embedded CSS to change the font color of the general text in the SIW to a blue hue that matches the Okta Ice logo.

Type in the following embedded CSS:

```html
<style>
  #okta-sign-in * {
    color: #0e2d5b;
  }
</style>
```

Finally, save your `HTML` file.

![Preview font color change](./.tour-resources/preview-text-color.gif)

### Inspect the SIW Form Header

Notice that our font color change was not applied to the `Sign In` header on above the form in the SIW. Let's inspect the Sign-In Page code again. In your latest preview of the Sign-In Page, right click on on the `Sign-In` text and select `Inspect`

When we do this, we see that the font color for this element is specified in the selector `#okta-sign-in.auth-container h2`

![Inspect the header text above the form](./.tour-resources/inspect-header.gif)

### Update the SIW Form Header Font Color

We're going to add some more embedded CSS to change the color of the form header to match the Okta Ice dark blue of the other text in the SIW.

Notice that this step highlights the line where you should be adding this code, which is just under the CSS we added in the previous step.

Append the following CSS to your code:

```css
#okta-sign-in.auth-container h2 {
  color: #0e2d5b;
}
```

Finally, save your `HTML` file.

### Inspect the SIW Header

Next, let's find out what selector we can access to change the background color of the SIW header area. In your latest preview of the Sign-In Page, right click into the header area of the SIW. Here we see the selector `#okta-sign-in.auth-container .okta-sign-in-header`

![Inspect SIW container](./.tour-resources/inspect-siw-container.gif)

### Update the SIW Header Background Color

Notice that this step automatically opens our HTML file and selects the line where we can add to our code. Let's add some custom CSS that will change the background color of the SIW header to a dark blue. We'll use the `#okta-sign-in.auth-container .okta-sign-in-header` selector to do this.

Append the following CSS code:

```css
#okta-sign-in.auth-container .okta-sign-in-header {
  background: #0e2d5b;
}
```

Finally, Save your `HTML` file.

![Preview bg color change](./.tour-resources/preview-bg-siw.gif)

### Inspect Link Element

Let's change the color of the `Help` so it stands out a bit more and matches our branding. In your latest preview of the Sign-In Page, right click on the `Help` link at the bottom of the SIW and select `Inspect`

Here we find the relevant selectors: `#okta-sign-in.auth-container .link:link` and `#okta-sign-in.auth-container .link:visited`

![Inspect link element](./.tour-resources/inspect-link.gif)

### Update the SIW Link Color

We're going to add to our embedded CSS at the indicated line of the HTML file. Not only are we going to define the link color, but we'll define the color for a visited link as well. We'll define both as a light blue.

Notice that this step highlights the line where you should be adding this code, which is just under the CSS we added in the previous step.

Append the following CSS code:

```css
#okta-sign-in.auth-container .link:visited,
#okta-sign-in.auth-container .link:link {
  color: #5ab9f2;

![Preview bg color change](./.tour-resources/preview-link.gif)

### Save and Publish Changes

If there's time remaining, feel free to continue tinkering and finding out what else you can customize here. When you're done, confirm the custom code change by clicking the `Save and Publish` button in the Sign-In Page Code Editor. There will be a modal dialog that pops up. Confirm the save and publish by clicking the appropriate button.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you've investigated additional customizations you can make to the Sign-In Page by using the embedded Sign-In Page Code Editor.

### Lab 2.4: Configure the Redirect Apps to Use the Custom Domain

üéØ **Objective:** Configure the redirect applications we set up previously to use the custom domain when redirecting users to the Okta-hosted Sign In Widget.

üé¨ **Scenario** When users authenticate into an Okta Ice app that uses the Okta-hosted Sign In Widget, they should be redirected to the widget through the custom URL rather than the Okta URL.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration:** 10 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisite:** Lab 2-1

### Configure the Authorization Server Issuer URI

We're going to configure the default Okta Authorization Server to to use either our Okta org URL or our custom URL as an Issuer URI -- depending on what our client application expects.

1. Ensure you're logged into the Okta Admin Dashboard as `oktatraining`
2. In the Admin menu, navigate to `Security` > `API`
3. Within the **Authorization Servers** table, local the `default` entry and click the blue pencil icon.
4. On the following screen, click `Edit`
5. In the `Issuer` section, select `Dynamic` from the drop down menu.
6. Click `Save`
7. **Logout** of Okta.

### Copy Redirect Applications

Copy the `redirect` folder from the Module 1 folder to this workspace.

### Edit the Customer Rewards App

Notice that `rewards.html` has been opened here for you and that the line defining `baseOktaURL` is highlighted.

Change the value of `baseOktaURL` so that it corresponds to your newly configured custom URL (e.g., https://oktaice########.coffee-ice.com). Save your `rewards.html` file.

### Edit the Franchisee CRM App

Notice that `crm.html` has been opened here for you and that the line defining `baseOktaURL` is highlighted.

Change the value of `baseOktaURL` so that it corresponds to your newly configured custom URL (e.g., https://oktaice########.coffee-ice.com). Save your `crm.html` file.

## Test Signing in with a Custom Domain

1. If you're not already logged out of Okta, log out now.

2. Open a terminal in VSCode and launch the web server with this command:

`python -m http.server 8080`

3. Once the web server is successfully launched, you'll see the following message in the terminal: `Serving HTTP on :: port 8080 (http://[::]:8080/) ...`

4. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

5. Click on `Rewards App (Redirect)`

6. Notice that you are now redirected to the Okta-hosted Sign In Widget via your custom URL!

7. Optionally log in as `soraya.esfeh@oktaice.com` / `Tra!nme4321` and log out when finished.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you've set up the Rewards and CRM applications to use the custom domain when redirecting to the Okta-hosted Sign In Widget for authentication.

### üéâ End of Module 2 Labs

**You may close this workspace project, ensuring all changes were saved.**

## Module 3: Exploring Authentication Protocol Flows

### Lab 3.1: Deploy Authentication with the Embedded Sign In Widget

üéØ Objective: Create an an Okta application integration and deploy authentication using the embedded Sign-In Widget.

‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 15 min

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Labs 1.4 and 2.4

### A Note on Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Recall that we have already enabled CORS for the Okta Ice Portal in Module 1. This is necessary when deploying authentication using the Embedded Widget model. In Okta, **CORS** allows JavaScript hosted on your website to make a request using an
`XMLHttpRequest` to the Okta API. Every website origin must be explicitly permitted as a **Trusted Origin** in your Okta org.

### Enable Interaction Code Grant Type

In order to use the Embedded Widget for Sign-In, the **Interaction Code** grant type must be turned on in our Authorization Server. We will do that in this step.

1. Ensure you are logged in to the Admin Panel as `oktatraining`
2. In the Admin menu, navigate to `Security` > `API`
3. In the **Authorization Servers** table, click the blue pencil icon in the `default` row.
4. Click on the `Access Policies` tab.
5. In the `Default Policy Rule` row, click the blue pencil icon.
6. Ensure that the `Interaction Code` option is selected.
7. Click `Update Rule`

### Create an Application Integration for the Customer Polling App

The Polling app is an existing application in this project. We're going to set up an integration in Okta so our customers can access this application.

1. In the Admin menu, navigate to `Applications` > `Applications`

2. Click `Create App Integration`

3. Select the `OIDC - OpenID Connect` radio button.

4. Select the `Single-Page Application` radio button.

5. Click `Next`

6. Name this application `Customer Polling`

7. Under **Grant Type** select both `Authorization Code` and `Interaction Code`.

8. In the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field, enter `http://localhost:8080/embedded/polling.html`

9. Under **Assignments** click the radio button option for `Limit access to select groups`

10. Type in and select `Customers`

11. Click `Save`

### Configure the Polling Application `appClientID`

1. Copy the `Client ID` that was displayed after you saved your integration.

2. Paste the `Client ID` into the `appClientID` variable above.

### Configure the Polling Application `baseOktaURL`

1. Update the value of `baseOktaURL` to match your **custom URL** (e.g., `oktaice########.coffee-ice.com`). You can use the **Credentials** panel in your VM to get the **Subdomain** of this URL.

2. [Click here to `Save`](command:workbench.action.files.save) your `polling.html` file.

### Import the Okta Sign-In Widget Library

We're going to import Okta's Sign In Widget JavaScript and CSS library from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) by adding the followng two lines to the `<head>` section of the Customer Polling app:

```html
<script
  src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/7.2.1/js/okta-sign-in.min.js"
  type="text/javascript"
></script>
<link
  href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/7.2.1/css/okta-sign-in.min.css"
  type="text/css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

1. Enter the code above into into `polling.html` on the line highlighted in the editor above.

2. Save your `polling.html` file.

The libraries imported here are the same ones used by the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget that we saw in Module 2.

Embedding the Sign In Widget directly to a page in your application allows for full customization.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have configured an application using the Embedded Sign-In Widget model of deploying authentication.

### Lab 3.2 Test Web SSO

üéØ Objective: Now that we have deployed authentication on two applications assigned to the Customers group, we can test out web SSO.

‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 10 min

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Labs 1.4, 2.4, and 3.1

### Copy Redirect Applications

In order to have working copies of the apps we previously configured (Redirect Model of deploying authentication) in our portal, we'll need to copy them to this workspace. This will be necessary to see how Web SSO works between our two Customer applications (Rewards and Polling).

Copy the `redirect` directory from the Module 01 folder to this workspace.

### Log Out of Okta

1. If you are still logged in on your Okta org, log out.

### Start the Web Server

1. Open a new terminal in VSCode

2. Notice that the terminal automatically opens to the project directory.

3. Issue the command `python -m http.server 8080`

### Test the Polling App

1. In Chrome, visit http://localhost:8080

2. Click the `Polling App (Embedded Widget)` link. If you don't see this link, refresh your browser.

3. Notice that you are not redirected to Okta for authentication. Instead, the Sign-In Widget loads on the page of your website.

4. Log in as `soraya.esfeh@oktaice.com`/`Tra!nme4321`

You should now see the ID Token (which is formatted as a JSON web token or **JWT**) value and its claims, including:

- `sub` (subject of the JWT): Soraya's Okta UserId
- `name`: Soraya's name
- `email`: Soraya's email address
- `ver`: Okta API version
- `iss` (issuer of the JWT): The URL of your Okta Authorization server
- `aud` (audience): Your app's Client Id
- `iat` (issued at time): Time the JWT was issued. Expressed in Unix time.
- `exp` (expiration time): Time the JWT expires. Expressed in Unix time.
- `jti` (JWT ID): Unique identifier used to prevent the JWT from being replayed

### Test the Rewards App

1. Click on `Return to Portal`

2. Click the `Rewards App (Redirect)` link.

3. Notice that you are not prompted to authenticate again as you have an existing session, so an ID Token is issued.

You should see the ID Token value and its claims. Much of this content is the same as you saw on the Polling App. However, notice that the `jti` (JWT ID) and the `aud` (audience) are different. You should now see that the `aud` is this Client ID of the Rewards app.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have seen how web SSO works between two applications accessible to members of the Customer group.

### üéâ End of Module 3 Labs

**You may close this workspace project, ensuring all changes were saved.**

At this point, Postman is now configured to make API calls to Okta. In the next lab, you will import the Okta Users API Collection. A collection is a group of saved API requests.

### Lab 4.2: Create an Okta User via the Users API

üéØ Objective: Import the Okta Users API collection into Postman and create an Okta user via API request.

‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 15 min

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisite: Lab 4.1

### Import the Okta Users API Collection Into Postman

1. Within the Chrome browser in your VM, visit https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/

2. Click `Run in Postman`

3. Click `Postman for Windows`

4. If prompted, click `Open Postman`

5. After a moment, you should see a toast notification saying that the **Users (Okta API)** collection was successfully imported.

6. Click on the `Collections` tab and you should now see the **Users (Okta API)** collection.

### Open the `Create Activated User with Password` Request

1. Click on the **Users (Okta API)** collection to expand it.

2. Click on the **Create User** subfolder to expand it.

3. Click on the **Create Activated User with Password** request to open it in a tab. This should be the **6th** one in the list of requests in the **Create User** subfolder.

### Examine the Request Params

Let's take a moment to examine this request and its parameters. Ensure you are on the `params` tab.

1. First hover over the `{{url}}` environment variable at the top of the request window. Verify that you see your Okta URL.

2. Next, look at the URI (relative to our base Okta URL) of the request endpoint: `/api/v1/users` This is the relative URI for all requests in this collection, though some requests may require additional URI parameters or query strings.

3. Observe that this request has a boolean `activate` URI parameter. When `activate` is set to true, this request will create a user with the status of `ACTIVE`

4. Finally, notice that this request uses the HTTP `POST` method. This method is used when creating a new web resource, in this case, an Okta User.

### Examine Request Header

1. Click on the `Headers` tab.

2. Notice that your API Token is being passed via the `Authorization` header via the `{{apikey}}` environment variable.

3. The `Accept` header communicates what type of data our client (Postman) can accept back in a response from Okta. Here, we accept `application/json` data.

4. The `Content-Type` header communicates the type of data we are sending in our request to Okta. This is also `application/json` data.

### Examine the Request Body

1. Click on the `Body` tab.

2. Here you will see `JSON` formatted data that represents a user. In this case, the `User` object is comprised of a `Profile` object and a `Credentials` object.

3. The `Profile` object consists of the four User profile attributes that are required by default on Okta: `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, and `login` (username).

4. The `Credentials` object consists of a `password`.

### Update the Request Body

The `Profile` object in this request only includes the four profile attributes that are required by default on Okta. We can include additional optional attributes as well!

We're going to update the `Profile` object's default attributes and add a `nickName` and `userType` attribute. Recall that we created a **Group Rule** in `Lab 1.2` that will automatically add a user with `userType` **customer** to our **Customers** group.

The `Credentials` object will be left unchanged.

Your updated request body will be:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "Samus",
    "lastName": "Aran",
    "email": "samus.aran@{{email-suffix}}",
    "login": "samus.aran@{{email-suffix}}",
    "userType": "customer",
    "nickName": "Sammy"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": { "value": "{{password}}" }
  }
}
```

You can copy and paste this JSON into the request body in Postman, replacing the existing JSON that is there by default.

### Update the `password` Environment Variable

1. Click the eyeball icon to the right of your Postman environment drop down.

2. Click `Edit`

3. Scroll down to the `password` variable and enter `Tra!nme4321` in the `CURRENT VALUE` column.

4. Click `Persist All` and then and click `Save`

5. Close the Environment variable tab and return to the **Create Activated User with Password** request tab.

### Send the Request

1. Click `Send`

2. Verify that you get a `200 OK` response (visible at the bottom of Postman). If not, go back and ensure you entered the JSON in your request body correctly and that all of your environment variables have been set correctly.

### Examine the Response

1. Click on the `Body` tab in the Response area (bottom half of the Postman window).

2. Notice that the response we get back from Okta is `JSON`

3. The first entry is the User's unique `id`.

4. The user has a status of `ACTIVE`

5. If you scroll down, you will find the `Profile` object you specified.

6. You will also see a `Credentials` object, but the password is not echoed back.

7. Finally, the `_links` section exposes additional Okta Users API endpoints relevant to this user's lifecycle. Notice that all of these links have the user's `id` as a URI parameter in them.

### Set the `userId` Environment Variable

You just saw that some API endpoints require a user's `id` as a URI parameter. Next, we're going to call an endpoint that will list all the Groups a user is a member of.

We'll store the `id` in the `userId` environment variable:

1. Scroll back to the top of the response body.

2. Highlight the value to the right of the first `id` entry (excluding the quotes).

3. Right click on the highlighted value.

4. Select `Set: {environment name}` and then `userId`

### Get Groups for User

1. In the `Users (Okta API)` collection, click on the `Get Groups for User` request to open it.

2. Notice that this endpoint uses the `{{userId}}` environment variable, which will pass in our user's `id` as a URI parameter.

3. Notice that the HTTP method used for this request is `GET`. We're requesting information about this user.

4. Click `Send` to send the request. You should get a `200 OK` response. If not, ensure you have correctly set the `userId` environment variable.

5. Examine the reponse body. The first entry in the JSON data should be the **Everyone** group.

6. Scroll down to locate the second entry in the JSON data, which should be the **Customers** group.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have created an activated user with a password using the Users API. This has allowed you to see how a User is represented in Okta.

### Lab 4.3: Update an Okta User Via the Users API

üéØ Objective: Update an existing Okta User using a request from the Okta Users API collection in Postman.

‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 15 min

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Labs 4.1 and 4.2

### Access Okta's Users API Documentation

Although the `Users (Okta API)` collection does not have a request to perform updates on a User's profile, the endpoint is documented here: https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#update-user

We'll use this documentation to craft our request in Postman.

From the documentation, we see that the endpoint we need to issue our request to is `/api/v1/users/{{userId}}` and that we should use the `POST` method for a partial update. A partial update means we only provide the data for the profile attributes we want to update.

Alternatively, the `PUT` method can be used for a complete update. This would mean that any attribute values that are not specified in the request body will be deleted from the user's profile.

For our purposes, we will use the `POST` method for a partial update.

### Create the Request

1. In Postman, click the `New` button.

2. In the window that pops up, click `HTTP REQUEST`

3. In the new request tab that opens, click the drop down menu and change the HTTP method from `GET` to `POST`

4. For the request URL, enter `{{url}}/api/v1/users/{{userId}}`

5. Click the down arrow next to the `Save` button an click `Save As...`

6. Enter `Update User` as the **Request name**

7. Select `Users (Okta API)` in the **Select a collection or folder to save to** section.

8. Click `Save`

### Set the Authorization Header

1. Click on `Headers`

2. In the next blank entry, enter `Authorization` in the `Key` column

3. Enter `SSWS {{apikey}}` in the `Value` column

4. Click `Save`

### Set the Request Body to JSON

1. Click on the `Body` tab of the request.

2. Click the `raw` radio button

3. Change the drop down value from `Text` to `JSON`

4. Click `Save`

### Create the Request Body JSON Payload

In order to update the User, we'll need to craft a JSON payload that specifies what profile attributes need to be updated.

In this case, we can imagine that the user's `lastName` needs to be updated. Since we are performing a partial update, we only need to specify this attribute in the Profile object of our JSON payload:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "lastName": "Nara"
  }
}
```

1. Copy and paste the JSON above into the body of your request.

2. Click `Save`

3. Click `Send` to issue the request.

### Examine the Response Body

1. You should get a `200 OK` response. If not, ensure you have followed all the prerequisite steps correctly, including setting the `userId` environment variable in `Lab 4.2`

2. Locate the Profile object within the JSON in the Response body.

3. Notice that the `lastName` is now updated, but all other profile attributes remain the same.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

You now have an understanding of how a partial update of a user's profile is performed by the Users API, which is used by Okta's Management SDKs.

## üéâ End of Module 4 Labs

**You may close this workspace project, ensuring all changes were saved.** You can also close Postman.

### üéâ End of Module 4 Labs

**You may close this workspace project, ensuring all changes were saved.**

## Module 5: Implementing Self-Service Registration

### Lab 5.1 Modify the Default User Profile Requirements.

üéØ **Objective** Update the required attributes in the Default User Profile to minimize sign up friction.

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice wants to simplify customer self-registration by only requiring a username and password. Additionally, Okta Ice does not want to enforce the default email-formatted username.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 15 minutes

### Access the User Profile Editor

1. Ensure you are logged in to the Admin dashboard as `oktatraining`

2. Click on `Directory` > ` Profile Editor` from the Admin menu

3. Click `User (default)` under the **Profile** column.

### Update Which Attributes Are Required

Recall that Okta requires four User Profile attributes by default: `login` (Username), `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email`

Let's change this!

1. In the **Attributes** section, click on the blue circular `i` icon that is in the **First name** `firstName` row.

2. Uncheck the `Attribute required` box.

3. Click the `Save Attribute` button.

4. Click on the blue circular `i` icon in the **Last name** `lastName` row.

5. Uncheck the `Attribute required` box.

6. Click the `Save Attribute` button.

### Update Username Requirements

By default, Okta requires usernames to be in the format of an email. Let's disable that requirement.

1. Click on the blue circular `i` icon in the **Username** `login` row.

2. Next to **Format restrictions**, select `None` from the drop down menu.

3. Do not save the changes just yet as we still have more to do in this section.

### Check Permissions on Attributes

In order to allow users to set their own username and email address during self-service registration, they will need write access to these attributes.

1. Still in the `Username` editing window, find the to **User permission** section.

2. Ensure the `Read-Write` radio button is checked.

3. Click the `Save Attribute` button.

4. Click the blue circular `i` icon in the **Primary email** `email` row.

5. In the **User permission** section, ensure the `Read-Write` radio button is checked.

6. Click the `Save Attribute` button.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have updated the default User Profile and attribute permissions. Now you are ready to enable self-service registration for Okta Ice's customer applications!

### Lab 5.2: Enable Self-Service Registration

üéØ **Objective** Configure Self-Service Registration for customer applications.

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice would like to allow customers to self-register to access customer applications.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 15 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Labs 1.4, 2.4, and 5.1

### Create Profile Enrollment Policy

1. Navigate to `Security` > `Profile Enrollment`

2. Click `Add Profile Enrollment Policy`

3. Name this policy `Customer Apps Enrollment Policy`

4. Click `Save`

### Enable Self-Registration in the Profile Enrollment Policy

1. Click the `Pencil icon` next to the policy you just created (`Customer Apps Enrollment Policy`)

2. Notice that `Self-service registration` is already `Allowed` in this policy. Keep it this way and stay on this page.

3. In the **Profile Enrollment** section, click `Edit`

4. Next to **Add the user to group**, enter and select `Customers`

5. Scroll down and click `Save`

### Add Customer Applications to the Profile Enrollment Policy

1. Click `Manage Apps`

2. Click `Add an App to this Policy`

3. Next to `Customer Rewards`, click `Apply`

4. Next to `Customer Polling`, click `Apply`

5. Click `Close`

### Specify Fields for the Enrollment Form

The Enrollment Form will appear during Self-Service Registation

1. Click the `Back to Profile Enrollment Policy` link at the top of the page.

2. Scroll down to the **Profile enrollment form** section.

3. Click `Add form input`

4. Select `Username (login)`

5. Click `Save`

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have configured self-service registration for the the customer applications.

### Lab 5.3 Customize an Email Template

üéØ **Objective** Customize the email template used to generate the email customers receive when they sign up for Okta Ice's customer apps.

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice would like to apply their own branding to the email that customers receive after registration. They also need to modify the HTML code so that customers are greeted by their username.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 15 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Labs 1.4, 3.1, 5.1, and 5.2

### Navigate to the Branding UI

1. Ensure you are logged in to the Okta Admin dashboard as `oktatraining`

2. From the Admin menu, go to `Customizations` > `Branding`

### Edit the Base Email Style

1. Under **Communication**, find the **Emails** section and click the `Edit` button.
2. On the **Emails** page, locate the **Base email styles** section and click `Configure`
3. Select `Solid background` -- this will replace the Okta logo with the logo we uploaded in Module 2. It will also set the email background color to the secondary color we set in Module 2.

4. At the top of the page, click `Save and publish`

### Navigate to the Emails UI

On the **Base email style** page, click on the `Emails` breadcrumb link to get to the mail **Emails** page.

### Open the Default Email Editor

Now we're going to customize the content of the **Email Factor Verification** email that users receive when they sign up for customer applications.

1. In the **Email Templates** table, locate and click on `Email Factor verification`

2. In the **Preview** window, select the `Code` tab and click on the `Edit` button within that window.

### Examine the Email Factor Verification Template

For your convenience, we've added an editable copy of the default HTML code used to generate the Email Factor Verification emails here in this VSCode workspace. It's called `default-email-template.html`

1. Examine the line above the comment. This generates the salutation.
   Notice that it references the profile attribute `user.profile.firstName`

2. Recall that we've updated the Default User Profile so that customers do not have to provide a first name. This means the email generated will look like:

`Hi , `

This doesn't look very professional at all, so let's fix this by greeting the user by their `login` (username) instead.

### Edit the Email Factor Verification Template

Let's edit the highlighted line so that it references the user's `login` profile attribute:

```javascript
Hi $!{StringTool.escapeHtml($!{user.profile.login})},
```

You can do this by manually editing the line.

Finally, save the file `custom-email-template.html` file.

### Import And Run Your Previously Configured Web Apps

We will now copy the web applications we previously configured to this workspace, so that we can test out self-service registration and the customized Email Factor Verification email.

1. Copy the `redirect` and `embedded` folders from the Module 3 folder to this workspace.

2. Open an terminal and run this command:

```
python -m http.server 8080
```

You should now see the following message in your terminal:

`Serving HTTP on :: port 8080 (http://[::]:8080/) ...`

### Explore Self Service Registration Availability

1. Log out of `oktatraining`

2. In Chrome, navigate to http://localhost:8080

3. Click on `Polling App (Embedded Widget)`

4. Notice there is now a `Sign up` link at the bottom of the Sign In Widget

5. Click on `Return to Portal`

6. Click on `Rewards App (Redirect)`

7. Notice that there is a `Sign up` link here as well.

8. Click the `Back` button in Chrome to return to the index page.

9. Click `CRM App (Redirect)`

10. Notice that there is no `Sign up` link here since this is a Franchisee app, and only applied our Profile Enrollment Policy to customer apps.

11. Once again, press the `Back` button in the Chrome browser to return to the index page.

### Test Self Service Registration

1. Click on `Rewards App (Redirect)`

2. Click on `Sign up`

3. For the **Email**, enter an email you have access to, so that you will be able to receive the Email Factor Verification email. If you have a Gmail account, we recommend using an email alias like `<your-gmail-username>+oktalab@gmail.com`. So if your email address was `samusaran@gmail.com`, you would enter `samusaran+oktalab@gmail.com`

4. Enter `oktalab` for the **Username**

5. Click the `Sign Up` button.

### Set Up a Password

You'll now be asked to set up a password.

1. Click `Setup up` under **Password**
2. Set and confirm your password as `Tra!nme4321`

3. Click `Next`

### Verify Your Email

Since you must verify our email upon self-service registration, you get to see your custom **Email Factor Verification** email!

1. In a new Chrome tab, login to the email you used to register your account and locate the **Confirm your email address** email.

2. Highlight and copy the numeric verification code.

3. Switch back to the tab where you initiated the self-registration process.

4. Paste the numeric verification code into the **Enter Code** field.

5. Click `Verify`

6. If you are prompted to set up any additional optional authenticators, click `Set up later`

You should now be redirected to the Rewards app.

### Test Web SSO

It may seem like you are only registered for the Rewards app. However, recall that our Profile Enrollment Policy adds self-registered users to the **Customers** group. So, you should have access to the Polling app too!

1. Click on `Return to Portal`

2. Click on `Polling App (Embedded Widget)`

Because you have an existing session and are a member of the **Customers** group, you are authenticated for the Polling App without having to register for this application or enter your credentials again!

### Close Your Okta Session

1. In the Polling App in the Chrome browser, click the `Close Okta Session` button. This will log you out of Okta.

2. You may now close this browser tab.

3. Keep your web server running, as it will be used in the next labs.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have customized the email template used to generate the **Email Factor Verification** customers receive when they sign up for applications. You have also verified that self-service registration works for customer applications, and that these users can access all customer applications via web SSO.

### Lab 5.4 Customize Implement a Registration Inline Hook

üéØ **Objective** Implement an Okta Inline Hook to customize the Profile Enrollment flow during Self-Service Registration.

üé¨ **Scenario** During their testing phase, Okta Ice would like to limit self-service registration to their customer applications to people with certain email domain names.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 20 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Labs 1.4, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3

### Preparation and Background

The Okta registration inline hook allows you to integrate your own custom code into Okta's Profile Enrollment flow. The hook is triggered after Okta receives the registration or profile update request. Your custom code can:

- Allow or deny the registration attempt, based on your own validation of the information the user has submitted

- Set or override the values that are populated in attributes of the user's Okta profile

This custom code must be accessible publicly on the Internet rather than our localhost.

Our custom code that will handle the profile enrollment flow during self-service registration is a Nodejs app hosted on Glitch at: https://es-okta-hooks.glitch.me/

### Examine `registrationHooks.js` - Routing

While our custom code for the inline hook is hosted on Glitch the contents of `registrationHooks.js` is copied and opened here so we can walk through it.

`registrationHooks.js` defines a route with the endpoint `/domain`. The anonymous function in this route gets called when the application receives a `POST` request to `https://es-okta-hooks.glitch.me/okta/hooks/registration/domain`

This is the URL Okta will need to call to via the inline hook during self-service registration.

### Examine `registrationHooks.js` - Payload Validation

When our application on Glitch receives a `POST` request to `domain`, the request data is validated. We check if there is a JSON object named `data` and if that object has a `userProfile` object. The `data.userProfile` object appears in SSR requests from Okta.

If `data` or `data.userProfile` are null, the application returns a response that tells Okta to `DENY` registration. Let's take a closer look at how that response is formed.

### Examine `registrationHooks.js` - Response to Invalid Payload

When Okta sends a request to your customer code via the Registration Inline Hook, Okta expects a JSON response that contains:

- an array of one or more **commands** to be executed by Okta

and/or

- an **error** object to indicate problems with the registration request

We can see in the code highlighted above that, if we have an invalid payload, we construct a `commands` array that contains one command of **type** `com.okta.action.update` and the **value** of that command is `"registration": "DENY"`

Additionally, we create an `error` object specifying that there was an invalid request payload. These two objects will be sent in the response to Okta.

This tells Okta to deny the registration request with the specified error.

### Examine `registrationHooks.js` - Parse Email

What happens if the payload our app receives is valid? We get the `email` from the `data.userProfile` object and parse out certain components of the email address to handle whether we will allow or deny the registration. This decision is handled by switch cases later on in the script.

- `emailName`: Everything to the left of the `@` symbol in the email address

- `emailDomain`: Everything to the right of the `@` symbol in the email address

- `emailPrefix`: We'll use a predetermined prefix that we'll append to email addresses (e.g. `allow.gmail.com`) to demonstrate how we can limit registration to specific email domains.

- `parsedEmail`: The complete email address without the `emailPrefix` so that we can still receive Okta activation emails when we register with an email like `user@allow.gmail.com` (the activation email will be sent to `user@gmail.com`)

### Examine `registrationHooks.js` - Allow Case

If a user attempts to register with an email address with the prefix `allow` in the domain, two commands are added to the `commands` array:

- The first command is of **type** `command.okta.action.update` with a **value** of `registration: "ALLOW"`

- The second command is of **type** `com.okta.user.profile.update` with a **value** of `email: parsedEmail`

Note that the command that allows registration is not required, as it is given by default. It is provided here for clarity. The second command that updates the user's email address is provided since we are using `allow.email.com` as a stand-in for our allowed email domain. Because we want to make sure the Okta activation email goes to our actual email address at `email.com`, we issue a command to update the user's profile with the actual email address without this special `allow` prefix.

Finally, there is no **error** object for this case since it is not relevant.

### Examine `registrationHooks.js` - Default Deny Case

If a user attempts to register with any other email address, the `commands` array will contain a single command to deny the registration, similar to the case when Okta sent an invalid payload.

In addition to this, an `error` object is created. The `errorCauses.errorSummary` string will be in the Sign-In Widget. The other information in this `error` object is used for logging purposes.

Both the `commands` array and `error` object are sent in the response to Okta later in this script.

#

## Create the Registration Inline Hook

1. Ensure you are signed in to the Okta Admin dashboard as your Super Admin account, `oktatraining`.

2. In the Admin menu, select `Workflow` > `Inline Hooks`

3. Click `Add Inline Hook` and select `Registration` from the drop down menu.

4. For `Name`, enter `Email Domain Registration Hook`

5. For `URL`, enter `https://es-okta-hooks.glitch.me/okta/hooks/registration/domain`

6. For `Authentication key`, enter `x-api-key`

7. For `Authentication secret`, enter `NOTUSED` (this is just a placeholder value for our class demonstration purposes)

8. Click `Save`

### Enable the Registration Inline Hook

üìù **Note:** You can associate only one inline hook at a time with your Profile Enrollment policy.

1. In the Admin menu, go to `Security` > `Profile Enrollment`.

2. Click the pencil icon next to `Customer Apps Enrollment Policy`

3. In the **Profile Enrollment** section, click `Edit`

4. In the **Inline Hook** section, select `Email Domain Registration Hook` from the drop down menu.

5. Click `Save`

6. **Log out** of Okta.

### Test the Registration Inline Hook

1. Visit the Okta Ice Portal at http://localhost:8080
   > > If your Okta Ice Portal app is no longer running, run in with this command:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

2. Click on `Rewards App (Redirect)`

3. Click the `Sign up` link

In the next steps, we are going to test the following cases (where `example.com` is any domain):

- **`allow.example.com`** - Registration will be allowed, and the response to Okta will include a debugContext message.

- **any other domain** - The response to Okta will include a command to deny the registration, an error object that will be displayed in the Sign-In widget, and a debugContext message.

### Test the Registration Inline Hook - Allow Case

1. In the `Email` field, enter an email address you can check so that it fits the `allow` case.

   > > For example, if your email is `user@gmail.com`, you would enter **`user@allow.gmail.com`**

2. For `Username`, enter `testuser`

3. Click `Sign Up`

4. You will now see that your registration is allowed since you are prompted to set your password. Set your password to `Tra!nme4321`

5. Check your email and enter the numeric code you receive in the `Enter Code` field.

You're now registered and logged in to the Customer Rewards app.

### Test the Registration Inline Hook - Default Deny Case

Now we'll test the default (deny) case, which should display a custom error in the Okta Sign-In widget

1. Click `Close Session` in the Okta Ice Portal app

2. Click `Return to Portal`

3. Click `Rewards App (Rewards)`

4. Click the `Sign up` link

5. In the `Email` field, enter your email address without any modifications.

6. In the `Username` field, enter `iamerror`

7. Click `Sign Up`

You will now see that your registration is denied with a custom error displayed in the Okta Sign-In widget:

```
Invalid email domain: gmail.com (message from inline hook)
```

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have created and enabled a Registration Inline Hook in a self-service registration Profile Enrollment Policy in Okta. This hook calls out to our custom Nodejs hosted on Glitch and determines whether or not a user can register for a customer application, depending on the value of their email address. Only users who register with `allow.example.com` email addresses will be permitted to register for customer applications.

### Lab 5.5: Implement a User Account Update Event Hook

üéØ Objective: Implement a User account update event hook

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice would like to forward user account update event information to their own external logging service.

‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 20 min

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Labs 1.4, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3

### Preparation and Background

Event hooks are outbound calls from Okta that can be used to notify your own software systems of events occurring in your Okta org.

Setting up an event hook in your Okta org requires the following generic steps:

1. Implement your external web service to receive event hook calls from Okta.

2. Register the endpoint of your external service with Okta and configure event hook parameters.

3. Verify to Okta that you control the endpoint.

4. Begin receiving ongoing delivery of event notifications.

### Examine `eventHooks.js`

While our custom code for the inline hook is hosted on Glitch the contents of `eventHooks.js` is copied and opened here so we can walk through it.

`eventHooks.js` defines two routes with the endpoint `/user-profile/update`. One handles a `POST` request, and the other handles a `GET` request.

Let's take a look at the `GET` route first.

### Examine `eventHooks.js` - `GET /user-profile/update`

When setting up an Okta event hook, Okta will issue a one-time `GET` request to the endpoint we specify. To verify that we truly own that endpoint, Okta requires a response with a request header named `verification` with whatever value Okta sent in its request header named `x-okta-verification-challenge`.

For example, if Okta sends a request with the header

```json
{ "x-okta-verification-challenge": "topsecret" }
```

Then, our application should send a response with the header:

```json
{ "verification ": "topsecret" }
```

Examine the highlighted segment in `eventHooks.js`. This segment handles `GET` requests to the `user-profile/update` endpoint. It extracts the value from the request header `x-okta-verification-challenge` and returns that value in a response header named `verification`. This meets the criteria Okta expects when verifying that we own the endpoint.

### Examine `eventHooks.js` - `POST /user-profile/update`

When Okta logs an event our event hook is registered to, Okta will sent to our a request to our endpoint. The `body` of that request will contain JSON data in the following format:

```json
{
"eventType": "com.okta.event_hook",
"eventTypeVersion": "1.0",
"cloudEventsVersion": "0.1",
"source": "<base-url-of-okta-org>/api/v1/eventHooks/#########",
"eventId": "################",
"data": {
    "events": [
        {  "uuid": "##################",
            "published": "#################",
            "eventType": "user.account.update_profile",
            "version": "0",
            "displayMessage": "Update user profile for Okta",
            "severity": "INFO",
            <...additional entries...>
        }
    ]
},
"eventTime": "2022-11-15T05:54:21.133Z",
"contentType": "application/json"
}
```

Examine the highlighted segment in `eventHooks.js` This handles the `POST` request to `/user-profile/update`. It will first verify that we received a valid request payload by checking that the `body` of the request contains a JSON object `data` with an entry named `events`. If we received a valid payload, the `eventType` entry located in the `events` JSON array is stored to a variable called `eventType`. In the example payload above, this would be `"user.account.update_profile"`.

The event type (embedded in a `description` string), requesting URL, and the entire request body, are then sent to the **Hook Viewer**, which stands in for our logging system. We'll look at the Hook Viewer when we start logging events.

### Create the User Account Update Event Hook

1. Ensure you are signed in to the Okta Admin dashboard as your Super Admin account, `oktatraining`.

2. In the Admin menu, select `Workflow` > `Event Hooks`

3. Click `Create Event Hook`

4. For `Name`, enter `User Account Update Event Hook`

5. For `URL`, enter `https://es-okta-hooks.glitch.me/okta/hooks/event/user-profile/update`

6. Leave the `Authentication` fields blank as we will not use them for the purposes of this lab.

7. Next to `Subscribe to events`, type in and select `User's Okta profile updated`

8. Click `Save & Continue`

### Verify the User Account Update Event Hook

At this stage, Okta will ask you to **verify** the endpoint that Okta will post event data to. This is where Okta will make a `GET` request with the `x-okta-verification-challenge` header and our application will send a `verfication` header in the response.

Click the `Verify` button.

If verification fails, double check that you have entered the correct `URL` in the previous step.

### Open the Hook Viewer

Open a new tab and visit https://es-okta-hooks.glitch.me/

We will use this page to view logged events. Keep in mind that the endpoint we are using in this example is shared among all classmates, so you will see events logged from other orgs here.

### Test the User Account Update Event Hook

1. Switch to your Okta tab

2. In the Admin menu, navigate to `Directory` > `People`

3. Click on `Kay West`

4. Click on the `Profile` tab.

5. Click `Edit`

6. Update the **Last Name** to `East`.

7. Expand the VM's **Credentials** panel.

8. Scroll down and click `Save`

### Check the Hook Viewer

1. Switch back to the Hook Viewer tab

2. Verify that an event was logged from your Okta org. Your org URL will be listed as the `source`

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have created and registered an Event Hook for logging updates to user's accounts to an external service using these four steps:

1. Implement your external web service to receive event hook calls from Okta.

2. Register the endpoint of your external service with Okta and configure event hook parameters.

3. Verify to Okta that you control the endpoint.

4. Begin receiving ongoing delivery of event notifications.

## Module 6: Migrating and Managing Users

### Lab 6.1: Migrate Users and Hashed Passwords with Okta's Users API

üéØ **Objective** Migrate users with Okta's Users API

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice has an existing data store of customers that they would like to migrate to Okta. They want customers to be able to sign in with their existing passwords. Since the passwords are hashed and salted, they can import these in bulk using Okta's Users API.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 20 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Labs 1.2, 4.1

#

## Examine the Create User with Imported Hashed Password API Endpoint

Okta's Users API has an endpoint that allows us to [create a user with an imported hashed password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-imported-hashed-password).

It is similar to the `Create User` endpoint we used in Lab 4.2, except we provide some additional details in the `credentials.password` entry of the JSON request payload:

```json
"credentials": {
    "password" : {
      "hash": {
        "algorithm": {{algorithm-name}},
        "workFactor": {{workfactor-value}},
        "salt": {{salt-value}},
        "value": {{hashed-password}}
      }
    }
  }
```

Notice that, instead of just providing a password value, we provide the hashing algorithm, a workfactor (if relevant to the hashing algorithm), the salt value, and the hashed value of the password.

Let's create this API request in Postman.

### Create a New API Request in Postman

Since the Create User with imported Hashed Password API request is not included in the Okta Users API collection, we will have to create it. We'll do this by duplicating a similar request, renaming it, and modifying the body of the request.

1. Open Postman

2. Ensure your Environment is set to the environment you created in Module 3. It should have the same name as your Okta org.

3. Expand the `Users (Okta API)` collection

4. Expand the `Create User` folder

5. Right click on `Create Activated User with Password` and select `Duplicate`

6. In the new API request tab that opens, hover your mouse over the title (`Create Activated User with Password Copy`) and the pencil icon that appears.

7. Rename this API request `Create User with Imported Hashed Password`

8. Click `Save`

### Modify the Request Body of the Create User with Imported Hashed Password API Request

1. Notice that this is a `POST` request. We are going to be sending data via the request body.

2. Delete the contents of the request body.

3. Copy the following JSON and paste it into the request body:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "Hashem",
    "lastName": "Pesar",
    "email": "hashem.pesar@{{email-suffix}}",
    "login": "hashem.pesar@{{email-suffix}}",
    "userType": "customer"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password": {
      "hash": {
        "algorithm": "BCRYPT",
        "workFactor": 12,
        "salt": "S77ORXjoSbjRMdvG/Yvc0u",
        "value": "x6WB1d4z5BjpeuyANyVWZqBbIfCq24q"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will import our existing user with a username of `hashem.pesar@oktaice.com` and their existing password that was previously hashed using the bcrypt algorithm with the salt provided. Notice that we also specify a `userType` of `customer` so that our existing Group Rule (Lab 1.2) will assign this user to the `Customers` group. This will give this user access to the customer apps.

### Create the User with an Imported Hashed Password

1. Click `Send` in Postman.

2. Examine the JSON response from Okta.

You'll notice Okta echoes back the user profile details. If you look at the `credentials` entry, you should see:

```json
"credentials": {
        "password": {},
        "provider": {
            "type": "IMPORT",
            "name": "IMPORT"
        }
```

This indicates that the user credentials were imported from an external source via the API.

### Test the Imported User

1. Copy the `redirect` and `embedded` directories from your Module 3 folder into this workspace.

2. Open a terminal and start a web server with the following command:

```
python -m http.server 8080
```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:8080

4. Click `Rewards App (Redirect)`

5. Enter `hashem.pesar@oktaice.com` as the **Username**

6. Click `Next`

7. Enter `Tra!nme4321` as the password

8. Click `Verify`

9. Once you are redirected to the Rewards App, click `Close Okta Session`

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have successfully imported an existing customer with their hashed password into Okta! In a real-world scenario, you would import users in bulk.

Okta employs built-in rate limit controls designed to protect the Okta service from the negative impacts that high traffic levels can create. This enables Okta to maintain service uptime and stability. As a result, during heavy usage periods an Okta tenant might experience traffic spikes that cause rate limits to go into effect. To avoid having rate limits impact your migration it‚Äôs suggested that you work with Okta support to plan your user migration during a time when rate limits can be temporarily adjusted and identify what the available options are for doing so.

### üéâ End of Module 6 Labs

**You may close this workspace project, ensuring all changes were saved.**

## Module 7: Securing Your Environment with Sign-On Policies and MFA

### Lab 7.1 Configure Passwordless Authentication with Email Magic Link

üéØ **Objective** Configure passwordless authentication with Email Magic Link

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice would like to provide customers with the option of using a passwordless method of authentication when accessing the Rewards and Polling apps.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 15 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisites:** Labs 1.4, 2.4, and 3.1

### Import And Run Your Previously Configured Web Apps

We will now copy the web applications we previously configured to this workspace, so that we can test out passwordless authentication and, later, multifactor authentication and self-service account recovery.

1. Copy the `redirect` and `embedded` directories from your Module 3 folder into this workspace.

2. Open a terminal and start a web server with the following command:

```
python -m http.server 8080
```

### Enable the Authentication and Recovery Options

1.In the Admin menu, go to `Security` > `Authenticators`

2. Click the `Actions` drop-down in the **Email** row of the list of authenticators.

3. Click `Edit`

4. In the **Used for** section, select `Authentication and recovery`

5. Click `Save`

This means that email can now be used as an authenticator and not just for account recovery. We'll still need to configure a Sign On policy to use email as an authenticator.

### Disable Unused Authenticators

For the purposes of this class, we'll only be using the Password and Email (Magic Link) authenticators. So, let's disable the ones we aren't using.

1. On the Authenticators page, click on the `Enrollment` tab.
2. Click the `Edit` button.
3. Change **Okta Verify** to `Disabled`
4. Change **Phone** to `Disabled`
5. **Email** should be `Optional` and **Password** should be `Required`
6. Click `Update policy` button

### Configure the Email Magic Link Authentication Policy

1. Ensure you are logged in to the Admin Dashboard as `oktatraining`

2. In the Admin menu, go to `Security` > `Authentication Policies`

3. Click `Add a Policy`

4. Name the policy `Email Magic Link`

5. Click `Save`

6. Click `Add Rule`

7. Name the rule `Customers Email Magic Link Rule`

8. Next to **User's group membership includes**, click the drop-down and select `At least one of the following groups`

9. In the `Enter groups to include` field that pops up below, search for and select the `Customers` group

10. Next to **User must authenticate with**, select `Any 1 factor type` from the drop-down.

11. Next to **Possession factor constraints are**, uncheck `Exclude phone and email authenticators`

12. Click `Save`

### Configure Customer Apps to Use the Email Magic Link Authentication Policy

1. Back on the `Email Magic Link` policy page, click the `Applications` tab.

2. Click `Add App`

3. Click the `Add` button next to `Customer Rewards App`

4. Click the `Add` button next to `Customer Polling App`

5. Click `Close`

6. Log out of Okta.

### Test the Email Magic Link Authentication Policy

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. Click on `Rewards App (Redirect)`
3. Enter the username `testuser`, which was previously registered with your personal email address in Module 5.
4. You now have the choice to authenticate with Email or Password. Click `Email`
5. Click `Send me an email`
6. Click `Enter a verification code instead`
7. Check your personal email for an email from your Okta Org and copy the numeric code into the `Enter Code` field
8. Click `Verify` and you will be logged in to the Customer Rewards application!
9. Click `Close Okta Session`
10. Click `Return to Portal`

üìù **Note**: In order for the clickable Email Magic Link to work, the link must be clicked in the same device that the authentication process was initiated. Since we're using a VM and you are likely checking your email on a personal device, we circumvent this by using the verification code instead.

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have configured and enabled passwordless authentication for Okta Ice's customers. You have done this by creating a Sign On Policy that specifies that any user in the customer group can sign in with any one factor. Since this policy was applied to the Customer Rewards and Customer Polling apps, customers can choose to authenticate with email or password when accessing this application.

### Lab 7.2: Configure MFA with Two Factor Types

üéØ **Objective** Configure multifactor authentication (MFA) with two factor types.

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice would like to secure the Franchisee CRM application with MFA. They'd like to require franchisees to authenticate with a knowledge factor (password) and a possession factor (email).

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 15 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisites:** Labs 1.2-1.4, 2.4, 3.1, and 3.2

### Make Yourself a Franchisee

1. Log in to your Okta org as `oktatraining` and access the Admin dashboard.

2. From the Admin menu, select `Directory` > `People`
3. Click on `Kay West`

   select `At least one of the following groups`
8. In the `Enter groups to include` field that pops up below, search for and
   select the `Franchisees` group

9. Next to **User must authenticate with**, select `Password + Another factor` from the drop-down.

10. Next to **Possession factor constraints are**, uncheck `Exclude phone and email authenticators`

11. Click `Save`

### Configure Franchisee CRM App to Use Two Factor Authentication Policy

1. Back on the `Franchisee Two Factor` policy page, click the `Applications` tab.

2. Click `Add App`

3. Click the `Add` button next to `Franchisee CRM App`

4. Click `Close`

5. Log out of Okta.

### Test the Two Factor Authentication Policy

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. Click on `CRM App (Redirect)`
3. Enter the **Username** `kay.west@oktaice.com` and click `Next`
4. Enter the **Password** `Tra!nme4321` and click `Verify`
5. You are now prompted for a email as a second factor of authentication.
6. Click `Send me an email`
7. Click `Enter a verification code instead`
8. Check your personal email for an email from your Okta Org and copy the numeric code into the `Enter Code` field
9. Click `Verify` and you will be logged in to the Customer Rewards application!
10. Click `Close Okta Session`
11. Click `Return to Portal`

üìù **Note**: In order for the clickable Email Magic Link to work, the link must be clicked in the same device that the authentication process was initiated. Since we're using a VM and you are likely checking your email on a personal device, we circumvent this by using the verification code instead.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have configured and enabled MFA using two authentication factors -- Knowledge (password) and Possession (email) You have done this by creating a Sign On Policy that specifies that any user in the Franchisee group must sign in with a password and an additional factor. Since this policy was applied to the Franchisee CRM app, any Franchisee must authenticate with a password and an additional factor. Since we've only configured email as an additional factor, that is the only other factor available in this case.

### üéâ End of Module 7 Labs

**You may close this workspace project, ensuring all changes were saved.**

## Module 8: Authenticating to Okta from External IdPs

### Lab 8.1 Authenticate with AD FS as an External IdP

üéØ **Objective** Set up AD FS as an external IdP.

üé¨ **Scenario** Okta Ice wants to allow customers to be able to authenticate via additional external IdPs. For our proof of concept that doesn't require getting developer keys from social IdPs (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we'll use AD FS.

‚è±Ô∏è **Duration** 20 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisites:** Labs 1.2, 1.4, and 2.4

### Review the Partner Organizational Unit in AD

The Partner OU contains users that are not synced to Okta via Active Directory. You will use these users to test using AD FS as an external IdP integrated through Okta.

1. In your VM, open `Active Directory Users and Computers` by clicking the ![Active Directory Users and Computers](./.tour-resources/adusersicon.png) icon in your Windows toolbar.

2. On the left panel of the **Active Directory Users and Computers** window, select`oktaice.local` > `Partners`

You should see that the `Partners` organizational unit (group) contains six users. One of these users is Diane Smith. We'll be using that account to test our local AD FS configuration before moving on to configuring AD FS as an external IdP through Okta.

### Validate your AD FS Configuration

In this section, you confirm that your AD FS can authenticate users from Active Directory.

1. Open Chrome and navigate to https://adfs.oktaice.local/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon

2. In the **Select Data Source** step, select the radio button next to `Import data about the relying party from a file`
3. Now click the `Browse` button.
4. In the file browser window that opens, navigate to the `Downloads` folder and double-click the `metadata.xml` file you downloaded from Okta.
5. Click `Next`
6. Enter `Okta Ice` as the **Display Name** and click `Next`
7. Continue clicking `Next`, taking the default values, until the Wizard reaches the last step.
8. Click `Close`

A window labelled **Edit Claim Issuance Policy for Okta Ice** should pop up. We'll configure the AD FS Claim rule in this window in the next step.

### Configure an AD FS Claim Rule

Claim rules define what user data will be sent from AD FS to Okta via SAML assertion.

1. In the **Edit Claim Issuance Policy for Okta Ice** window, click `Add Rule...`
2. Select `Send LDAP Attributes as Claims` in the **Claim rule template** drop-down and click `Next`
3. **Name** the claim rule `Attributes to Okta`
4. Select`Active Directory` under the **Attribute store** drop-down.
5. Under **Mapping of LDAP attributes to outgoing claim types** add these additional attributes:

| **LDAP Attribute** | **Outgoing Claim Type** |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `Given-Name`       | `firstName`             |
| `Surname`          | `lastName`              |
| `E-Mail-Addresses` | `email`                 |
| `E-Mail-Addresses` | `Name ID`               |

Finally, click `Finish` and then click `OK` in the **Edit Claim Issuance Policy for Okta Ice** window.

### Test Authentication with AD FS

1. Copy the `redirect` and `embedded` directories from your Module 3 folder into this workspace.

2. Open a terminal and launch a webserver with this command:

`python -m http.server 8080`

3. Navigate to http://localhost:8080

4. Click `Rewards App (Redirect)`

5. Enter `diane.smith@oktaice.local` as the **Username**

6. Click `Next`

7. Enter `diane.smith@oktaice.local` as the **Username** and `Tra!nme4321` as the **Password**

8. Click `Verify`

The user should now be logged in via AD FS as an IdP. This should also create a new Okta-managed user via Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning with the profile attribute mapping we set up in AD FS.

Finally, click `Close Okta Session`

### Verify JIT Provisioning

1. Log back in to the Okta Admin Dashboard as `oktatraining`
2. Click `Directory` > `People`
3. Search for `Diane Smith` and click on the user
4. Confirm that Okta displays the message **Profile sourced by SAML 2.0 IdP**.
5. Click the `Profile` tab.
6. Confirm that the user profile now contains the user email and name. This confirms that the Just in Time provisioning (JIT) is working.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

At this point, you have Okta integrated with AD FS as Identity Provider using SAML. This integration allows users located under the Partner OU to log into Okta using via AD FS. Okta leverages Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning to automatically recognize and create users federated via integration with AD FS.
